# ApocalypseComics
Short Demo Project to show how to use Marvel Api. It provides you list of comics from 1st of January 2020 to 2th of May in  which X-Factor's and X-men's
supervillian Apocalypse appeared. By tapping in comic cover you will navigate to details section were you can see info about comic creators. Planned to add description too
but as currently for every comic the api returns null I resigned from the field.

To start the App you will need a Marvel's api-key and private key from https://developer.marvel.com/ . Just provide them to appropriate gradle fields. All hash count logic will be done by ApiHashProvider class.
